# SvelteKit SSR Template for Noop

This repository contains a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte). The purpose of the repository is to act as a starting point for a new application running on the [Noop Developer Platform](https://noop.dev/).

## Getting Started

To create and run an instance of this Template [install Workshop](https://noop.dev/docs/installation/) and select the SvelteKit SSR Template.

Navigate to the Environment dashboard in Noop Workshop and toggle the `Active` switch.

Clicking the endpoint link from the Environment dashboard will load the app in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying files within the `src` directory. The page will auto-updates as you edit the file.
